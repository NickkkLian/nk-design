name: nk-design
description: Build a single-file data tool from one sentence (a review queue, a ledger, a tracker, an admin panel) in a design system where every number shows where it came from and what was not checked. The page carries provenance chips beside derived values, a reconciliation bar on the first screen whose parts are computed live and add up, a fixed status vocabulary that never relies on colour alone, a Demo marker for synthetic data and a footer that says what is not verified. Three palettes and light/dark come from one token file, restored before first paint. Ships the token file, a working starter page and scripts/ui_check.py with fourteen machine rules. Use when asked for a dashboard, queue, ledger, tracker or internal tool, when a demo has to read as a real product in thirty seconds, or to review such a page. Not a marketing-site style and not a component library.

# Evidence-visible design

**A data tool is believed when its numbers can be traced, added up and questioned on the screen, not when
it is pretty.** This skill turns that into rules a page either meets or does not: every derived value has a
provenance chip next to it, the first screen opens on a reconciliation bar whose sum is computed live, the
status words are a fixed vocabulary, simulated actions say so, and the footer says what is not verified.

> **Paths.** Commands in this skill start with `${…SKILL_DIR}`: this skill's own folder, the one that contains this SKILL.md. Claude Code fills it in. If your agent shows the placeholder as written (Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI and others), replace it with that folder's absolute path before you run the command. Left as it is, it expands to nothing and the path breaks.

## When this applies

- Someone describes a data tool in one sentence ("an invoice review queue for a three-person bookkeeping
  firm") and wants a page that works, not a mock-up.
- Building a dashboard, workbench, admin panel, review queue, ledger, tracker, importer, "internal tool".
- A demo that has to convince a stranger in thirty seconds that it is a product and that the author knows
  what has and has not been checked.
- Reviewing such a page: run the checker first, then the browser list.
- Not for marketing sites, landing pages or general visual polish: the signature only means something where
  data is loaded, counted and decided on.

## Procedure

1. **Start from the starter page**, not from a blank file: copy `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/assets/starter.html` and
   `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/assets/design-tokens.css` into the same folder. The starter already works: seeded
   synthetic rows, a reconciliation bar computed from them, a sortable and filterable table, a row inspector,
   a theme picker and the honest footer. The page only consumes semantic tokens (`--surface`, `--anchor`,
   `--danger` …); raw values live in the token file and nowhere else.
2. **Map the sentence onto the starter's three parts**: what one row is (its fields, statuses and source),
   what the first screen has to add up (the reconciliation bar's segments and total), and what a person
   decides for a row (the inspector's actions). Replace the data generator and the labels; keep the structure.
3. **Keep the seven invariants** (`references/invariants.md`): top bar on the anchor band, mark built by
   rule, the signature plate with the reconciliation bar, a provenance chip beside every derived value, the
   status vocabulary, the honesty block, one token file with the appearance contract.
4. **Spend boldness in one place.** The deep anchor colour carries the top bar, the signature plate, the
   footer and the one primary button; one point colour stays on a small share of the page; everything else
   converges: one display face for titles, one sans for the interface, one monospace face for numbers and
   identifiers, small radii, borders before shadows.
5. **Use the status vocabulary as given** (`references/components.md` §tag): Needs review · Approved / Booked
   / Sent · Rejected / Failed · Draft · Simulated · Excluded · Blocked. A second channel beside the word — a dot,
   a check mark or a stop sign, drawn as line SVG and never typed as a symbol or emoji — never colour alone.
6. **Be honest by construction** (`references/honesty.md`): synthetic data looks synthetic and is labelled
   `Demo ·`; every number on the page is computed from the loaded data; nothing simulated shows as sent;
   the footer carries About this demo / Not verified here / Source.
7. **Keep the appearance contract.** A small script in `<head>`, before the first stylesheet, reads the saved
   palette and scheme (or `?theme=` / `?scheme=` in the URL) and sets `data-theme` / `data-scheme` before the
   first paint. The defaults write no attribute, so the page as served has neither. The picker lives in a
   Settings card; one `theme-color` meta follows the chosen surface.
8. **Check before you show it**: `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/ui_check.py index.html` runs fourteen
   rules (one primary button, no hard-coded colours outside the token block, sortable tables, no
   `transition: all` and a reduced-motion block, focus never removed silently, honesty words, demo marker,
   chip and reconciliation bar present, only font and GitHub hosts, meta tags, `minmax(0,1fr)`, no
   real-looking contacts, the appearance contract, icons drawn as SVG rather than typed as characters). Then the browser list in `references/acceptance.md`
   (first screen at 1280×800, 375 px wide with real data volume, keyboard path, every palette in light and
   dark, contrast).
9. **Ship with the page**: a 1280-wide screenshot in the README, the demo link, the one-line positioning
   sentence with its guard clause ("… — every row stays traceable").

## Boundaries

- The checker reads the file; it cannot see layout, contrast on a rendered page, or a screenshot.
  `references/acceptance.md` lists the checks that need a browser and how to do them.
- The token file is a starting palette: change the brand names, and if you change colours keep the contrast
  pairs (every text colour in the file was solved against the hardest surface of its theme).
- No external component library and no CDN scripts. Web fonts are the only optional external request: the
  page must open offline with system fonts in their place and nothing else changed.
- The starter ships synthetic data only. Loading real records is the user's decision, and it changes what
  the footer has to say.

## Provenance

The author's own product-family design system, 2026-09. The first version was written after four public
data tools each shipped with a different look and none of them showed where their numbers came from; the
seven invariants, the signature elements and the honesty constraints were written for what a stranger
checks in the first thirty seconds. The current version kept those rules and fixed what screenshots
measured in the first: almost no dark mass (1.28% of the rendered light-theme pixels below L* 40) and no
real colour (95th-percentile chroma 0.090), so it added a deep anchor surface and one point colour, and a
palette and light/dark choice that survives a reload. No external design system was copied; where a public
method informed a decision (an accent-in-one-place rule, named easing curves), the reference file says so.
